## Start JupyterLab

Make sure you have the following installed. The collaboration package is needed as the modifications made on the notebook can be seen thanks to [Jupyter Real Time Collaboration](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/rtc.html).

```bash
python -m pip install jupyterlab jupyter-collaboration ipykernel
python -m pip uninstall -y pycrdt datalayer_pycrdt
python -m pip install datalayer_pycrdt
```

Then, start JupyterLab with the following command.

```bash
jupyter lab --port 8888 --ip 0.0.0.0 --NotebookApp.token='' --NotebookApp.password='' --NotebookApp.disable_check_xsrf=true --allow_remote_access=true
```

Now the jupyter server is already deploy in `http://localhost:8888`
